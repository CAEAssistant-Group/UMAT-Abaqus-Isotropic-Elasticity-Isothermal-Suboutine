# UMAT-Abaqus-Suboutine
The UMAT subroutine in Abaqus serves as a solution for modeling materials that cannot be accurately represented using the standard Abaqus material library. For this project, we utilized this subroutine to study a 3D isotropic isothermal beam. Additional projects in this field can also be accessed on the following link.

The problem, as shown in the figure, involves a 3D anisotropic isothermal beam. We analyzed it once using Abaqus's built-in material model and again using the UMAT Abaqus subroutine, comparing the stress patterns. The results matched exactly.

Additionally, we’ve made all modeling files and a free training video on UMAT and related workshops available on our website for download.

There’s also a free PDF offering a comprehensive explanation of the UMAT subroutine and workshops, which we highly recommend.
